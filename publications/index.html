                <p>Iatrogenic haryngoesophageal perforations treated with fully covered self-expandable metallic stents</p>
                <p>Iatrogenic pharyngoesophageal perforations are a rare but serious complication of endoscopy. Surgical and non-surgical approaches have been reported but result in a significant morbidity and extended hospital stay. Therefore, an unmet need exists for an alternative management technique. We demonstrate a new endoscopic approach for the management of iatrogenic pharyngoesophageal perforations through the use of esophageal fully covered self-expandable metallic stents (FCSEMS)</p>

                <p>Childhood Bell’s palsy is a rare clinical entity that possesses a challenge to the medical team in terms of diagnosing and managing this condition.

Users can sign up and search a database of foods offered in Bowdoin's dining halls, then add their favorites to a list to recieve alerts the next time they're offered. I developed the site over eight months starting in the summer of 2013 and have now launched it on campus.</p>

The site listens for pull requests made to the team's GitHub account, then checks new code out to an EC2 instance and runs unit and integration tests on it. A Rails interface lets developers view the status of builds and their reasons for breaking. This project is still under active development.</p>

                <p class="project-text">Historysnap is a Flask application I built while playing with the Snapchat API. The site uses <a href="http://archive.org">Archive.org</a> to find a newsreel published on this date in history. Using FFMPEG, the site then splits the reel up into 15-second segments and sends them to you via Snapchat. I hacked on Historysnap for a weekend, then never finished it because Snapchat kept shutting down my account for TOS abuse.</p>

Together, we developed software for a local food bank that allows volunteers to track and schedule shifts (an operational task previously done entirely on paper). This project has allowed the Midcoast Hunger Prevention Program to expand its hours and reach.</p>
