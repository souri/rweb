  <p class="posttitle">Hi! I'm Reetika. I've recently graduated as a medical student from St. John's Medical College, Bangalore.</h2>
    <p>I'm currently working in Boston at Raizlabs, a mobile development company. I write responsive web apps with a focus on mobile and craft the APIs that power native experiences. In my free time I hack on a newsroom CMS, train robots to play soccer, take photos and write web apps for fun and profit.  I get excited about quality software, open-source contributions, modern web standards and new technologies at every level of the stack. Please use this page to learn about what I'm working on and to get in touch.</p>
