  <p class="posttitle">Hi! I'm Reetika. I've recently graduated as a medical student from St. John's Medical College, Bangalore.</h2>
    <p>I'm currently working on to clear my USMLE Step 1, after completing my research internship at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, so I can further pursue my studies in medicine. In my free time I collaborate with people I've previously worked with in research. I'm mostly interested in gastroenterology, otorhinolaryngology, surgery and endocrinology. I'm also excited by studies in behavioral sciences. I believe that access to advances in medical sciences should be for all, with the humanatarian nature of the science itself.  Arts is an inspiration for me and I love to paint at my leisure. I also slay zombies in my head everyday, and eat dinosaurs for breakfast.</p>

      <p>Please use this page to learn more on what I'm working on and to get in touch.</p>
